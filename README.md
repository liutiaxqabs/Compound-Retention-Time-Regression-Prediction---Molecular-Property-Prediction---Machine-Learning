# Compound Retention Time Regression Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the retention time properties of compounds using machine learning techniques. Utilizing the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representation of compounds, along with the RDKit and scikit-learn packages, we aim to predict the retention times of compounds in specific environments. This framework is applicable for a variety of regression property predictions related to compound representation.

## Installation Guide

Ensure Python is installed on your machine. This project is recommended to be run with Python 3.7 or later. Python can be downloaded and installed from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/).

Next, install the required dependencies. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install rdkit-pypi
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

These commands will install RDKit, scikit-learn, and the Pandas and NumPy libraries for data processing.

## Running the Project

1. Clone or download the code repository of this project.
2. Open the directory where the project is located.
3. Modify the data storage paths in the code to point to your data files.
4. Run the main Python script to train the model and predict retention times.

   For example, if the main script is named `main.py`, you can run it with the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Ensure that your data files match the expected format and that the paths are correctly set.
