# Compound-Retention-Time-Regression-Prediction---Molecular-Property-Prediction---Machine-Learning
Using the open-source RDKit and scikit-learn packages, we predict the retention time properties of compounds based on their SMILES representation. This document can be extended to address a wide range of regression property prediction problems related to compound representation.
